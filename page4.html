    <p>The activity I do that I would like to highlight is golf. I play golf for Pasadena High School and I have been on the team since freshmen year. It is fun to go out and play golf with people from other schools and my teammates. Golf has taught me patience and good sportsmanship. I chose this activity because it is fun, relaxing and I really like playing golf. The advice I would give to someone about the sport is to be patient.</p>
