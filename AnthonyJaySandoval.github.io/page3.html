    <p>The project I have chosen is one I did about Estuaries in a group with two of my colleagues for my Advanced Placement Environmental Science class. In the project we explain what an Estuary Biome is. In the project we also point out the organisms that live in estuaries, where they are located and it features. The main purpose of the project is to tell of the harm that humans are doing to these biomes.</p>
